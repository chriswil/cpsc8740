## Setup and Introduction
   
**AI Tools** 

I chose to use:
* PyCharm IDE + Claude Code running in Terminal
* Claude Chatbot

**Intro to tools**

I am a software developer for my day job, and doing mostly Python these days, so I chose an IDE
that I'm comfortable working with for editing and debugging code. I am using Claude Code for code
generation and assistance with  for the 3 apps that we're working on.

For brainstorming possible ideas and thinking ideas of what I'd like to implement with Claude Code, 
I'm using the Claude desktop app for general queries, as well as looking up frameworks and APIs that
Claude Code suggests during implementation.
